-- Issue #27: Export GeoJSON File with Assessment Values for Residential Properties
-- Completed By: Joshua Rigsby
-- Language: SQL (obvi)
-- 
-- Description:
-- Script queries residential property data for export as a
-- GeoJSON file to be converted into vector tiles for the assessment dashboard.
-- 
-- Used:
-- core.pwd_parcels
-- core.opa_properties
-- core.opa_assessments
-- core.neighborhoods
-- derived.current_assessments
-- 
-- Summary:
-- 1. Query the most recent official tax year assessment value per property
-- 2. Transform to get assessment history to get 2023 and 2024 assessed values
-- 3. Join parcel geometry (pwd_parcels) with property characteristics
--    (opa_properties), official assessments (opa_assessments), and
--    ML-predicted values (derived.current_assessments)
-- 4. Calculate percent change between predicted and last official value
-- 5. Filter to residential properties only
-- 6. Output geometry and selected fields for hover tooltip and
--    click-popup panel in dashboard
